Simulate the Elves' process and find the smallest rectangle that contains the Elves after 10 rounds. How many empty ground tiles does that rectangle contain?

If there is no Elf in the N, NE, or NW adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving north one step.
If there is no Elf in the S, SE, or SW adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving south one step.
If there is no Elf in the W, NW, or SW adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving west one step.
If there is no Elf in the E, NE, or SE adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving east one step.
After each Elf has had a chance to propose a move, the second half of the round can begin. Simultaneously, each Elf moves to their proposed destination tile if they were the only Elf to propose moving to that position. If two or more Elves propose moving to the same position, none of those Elves move.

Finally, at the end of the round, the first direction the Elves considered is moved to the end of the list of directions. For example, during the second round, the Elves would try proposing a move to the south first, then west, then east, then north. On the third round, the Elves would first consider west, then east, then north, then south.
